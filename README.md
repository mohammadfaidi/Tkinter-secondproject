Letâ€™s try to extend our previous example, by adding a couple of Labels (label is a simple widget which displays a piece of text or image) and button(button are usually mapped directly onto a user action which means on clicking a button, some action should occur) in the code.


Create a simple form for registration using Tkinter.
It will asks the user to enter his name, job and salary in the specified fields.
Then, It will summarize these information (in Label widget) by clicking on a button.
